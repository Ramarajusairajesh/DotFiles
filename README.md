This is my linux configs automation script i written myself ! 

  To run this script follow these steps:
    chmod +x ./install.sh
    sudo /.install.sh


  Or you can do it in one line
     sudo bash ./install.sh
This install files install Nvidia drivers along cuda ,brave browser , and other things I think useful !
